    <p class="intro">Currently I'm very busy with college, so I haven't had the chance to go out
    exploring as much as I'd like. So, sadly, the real fun stuff will have to wait
    until after graduation. </p>

    <p>As you've probably already seen, I'm kind of a huge fan of Fall
Out Boy. However, I've never been to one of their concerts before (or any
concerts, for that matter), so this past summer I decided to just go for it and
bought tickets. My best friend is also a huge Fall Out Boy fan, so we chose the
St. Louis tour date since it was the middle point betweeen the two of us and
also close enough to my birthday that it could count as a birthday celebration.
That impulse buy was probably one of the best I've ever made, because the
concert was one of the coolest experiences of my life. Exploring St. Louis the
day after the concert was pretty fun too, though I don't like to admit it (KC vs
STL rivalries, you know). If you're ever visiting St. Louis, I'd definitely
recommend visiting the City Museum and the zoo. Sadly, I didn't get to try any
"authentic" St. Louis foods, so if I ever visit again, I'll be on the hunt for
gooey butter cake. </p>
