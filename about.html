  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p/>
    I am currently a third year Digital Humanities major at Illinois Tech. I
    am the oldest of five siblings, so most of my friends think of me as the "mom
    friend". I love to read books and enjoy writing as well. I also love to express
    myself through many different forms of art, including drawing, painting, and
    experimenting with makeup. I also love listening to music, and am a huge fan of
    Fall Out Boy. I enjoy visiting new places and spend an embarrassing amount of my
    paychecks trying new food at different restaurants. I don't really know what I'm
    going to do after college yet, but I know I want to be able to help others as
    much as I can.
